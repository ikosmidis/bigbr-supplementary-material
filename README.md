### Contents

The Supplementary Material provides

i) the Supplementary Material document that is cross-referenced above
and contains all numerical results and figures from the case study of
Section 4 and the computer experiment of Section 5 of the manuscript;

ii) R code to reproduce all numerical results and figures in the main
text and in the Supplementary Materials document.

The code is organized in the two directories `diverted-flights` and
`high-dim-logistic`, for the case study of Section 4 and the computer
experiment of Section 5, respectively. The `README` file in each
directory provides specific instructions about have the results can be
