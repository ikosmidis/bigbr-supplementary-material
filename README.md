The current repository provides the Supplementary Material for the
manuscript

> Zietkiewicz P and Kosmidis I (2023). Bounded-memory adjusted scores
> estimation in generalized linear models with large data sets.


The Supplementary Material provides

i) the Supplementary Material document that is cross-referenced above
and contains all numerical results and figures from the case study of
Section~\ref{sec:air2000} and the computer experiment of
Section~\ref{sec:highdim} of the manuscript

ii) R code to reproduce all numerical results and figures in the main
text and in the Supplementary Materials document.

The code is organized in the two directories {\tt diverted-flights}
and {\tt high-dim-logistic}, for the case study of
Section~\ref{sec:air2000} and the computer experiment of
Section~\ref{sec:highdim}, respectively. The \texttt{README} file in
each directory provides specific instructions about have the results
can be reproduced, along with the specific versions of the contributed
R packages that have been used to produce the results.
