Description: Regression for data too large to fit in memory. It implements maximum likelihood for all Generalized Linear Models, and the reduced-bias estimator of Firth (1993) <doi:10.1093/biomet/80.1.27> and maximum Jeffreys'-penalized likelihood Kosmidis & Firth (2021) <10.1093/biomet/asaa052> for binomial- and Poisson-response Generalized Linear Models.
