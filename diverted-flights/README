This directory provides the data and scripts to reproduce the case
study for modelling Diverted US flights in 2000 in Section 4 of the
manuscript.

The required 

The easiest way to reproduce the relevant outputs in the manuscript is
to

1. edit "0-replicate.R" by determining

   a. change the path in the `devtools::load_all` call to the path to
   the port of the biglm R package (also distributed as part of the
   supplementary).

   b. set `n_cores` appropriately to determine the number of cores you would like
   to use.

   c. set `experiment_path` to the path where the current file is

2. in a terminal run

> Rscript --no-init-file 0-replicate.R

from the directory where the current file sits
