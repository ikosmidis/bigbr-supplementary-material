This directory provides the data and scripts to reproduce the results
from the case study on modelling Diverted US flights in 2000 in
Section 4 of the manuscript, and in Section S1 of the Supplementary
Material document.


The contributed R packages needed are memisc and dplyr. The results
have been obtained with memisc v0.99.31.6 and dplyr v1.1.2.


The easiest way to reproduce the relevant outputs in the manuscript
and the Supplementary Material document is to

1. edit "0-reproduce.R" as follows:

   a. change the path in the `devtools::load_all` call to the path to
   the port of the biglm R package (also distributed as part of the
   supplementary).

   b. set `n_cores` appropriately to determine the number of cores you would like
   to use.

   c. set `experiment_path` to the path where the current file is

2. in a terminal run

> Rscript --no-init-file 0-reproduce.R

  from the directory where the current file sits


You can also you an interactive R session and run the scripts
1-prepare-data.R, 2-fit-model.R, and 3-output-tables.R in that
order. 1-prepare-data.R will output data/air2000_combined.rds, and
2-fit-model.R will output results/diverted-fits.rda, which is used by
3-output-tables.R
